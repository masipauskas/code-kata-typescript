Code Kata - TypeScript
==============================

This is a wrapper project for doing code kata exercises in TypeScript.

It is only meant to be used as practice for TDD / BDD exercises, therefore, it utilizes build via npm scripts instead of using a build system. It shouldn't be used as a seed project for any serious TS development.

To run the project do the following:
   * `git clone https://github.com/masipauskas/code-kata-typescript`
   * `npm install`
   * `tsd install`
   * to run unit tests: `npm test`
